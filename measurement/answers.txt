Q2: Latency H1->H4 = L1 + L2 + L3 = 40+10+30 = ~80ms (x2 for RTT) = ~160ms
    Throughput H1->H4 = min(L1, L2, L3) = 20Mbps


Q3: Latency will be * N, for N = num pairs
    Throughput will be / N, for N = num pairs

Outputs:
	Pairs:
	avg RTT: 160.926ms
	throughput: 10.341Mbps
	
	Triples:
<<<<<<< HEAD
	avg RTT: 160ms (has science gone too far?)
	throughput: 7.57Mbps

Q4: The shared link will have to be multiplexed:
	Bandwidth: h1->h4 = L1 + L2/2 + L3
        Bandwidth: h5->h6 = L4 + L2/2 + L5
	Latency: h1->h4 = L1 + L2*2 + L3
	Latency: h5->h6 = L4 + L2*2 + L5 
=======
	avg RTT: 160ms
	throughput: 7.57Mbps

Q4: The shared link will have to be multiplexed:
	Guess:
	Bandwidth: h1->h4 = MIN(BWL1,  BWL2/2 , BWL3) = 20 Mbps
        Bandwidth: h5->h6 = MIN(BWL4 , BWL2/442 , BWL5) = 20 Mbps
	Latency: h1->h4 = 2x(LTL1 + LTL2*2 + LTL3) =  180ms
	Latency: h5->h6 = 2x(LTL4 + LTL2*2 + LTL5) = 60ms

	Actual:
	Bandwidth: h1->h4 = 20.09
        Bandwidth: h5->h6 = 21.39
	Latency: h1->h4 = 160.876
	Latency: h5->h6 = 40.727

	All of our answers are over because we assumed that ping would max out the 
	shared link(L2) and double the time to send over that link. 
	a better calculation of latency would be 
	Latency: h1->h4 = 2x(LTL1 + LTL2 + LTL3) =  160ms
	Latency: h5->h6 = 2x(LTL4 + LTL2 + LTL5) = 40ms
